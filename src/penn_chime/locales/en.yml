    The model consists of individuals who are either _Susceptible_ ($S$), _Infected_ ($I$), or _Recovered_ ($R$).

    The epidemic proceeds via a growth and decline process. This is the core model of infectious disease spread and has been in use in epidemiology for many years.
  "The dynamics are given by the following 3 equations.": "The dynamics are given by the following 3 equations."
  "To project the expected impact to Penn Medicine...": |+
    To project the expected impact to Penn Medicine, we estimate the terms of the model.

    To do this, we use a combination of estimates from other locations, informed estimates based on logical reasoning, and best guesses from the American Hospital Association.


    ### Parameters

    The model's parameters, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, determine the virulence of the epidemic.

    $$\beta$$ can be interpreted as the _effective contact rate_:
  "which is the transmissibility multiplied...": |+
    which is the transmissibility ($\tau$) multiplied by the average number of people exposed ($$c$$).  The transmissibility is the basic virulence of the pathogen.  The number of people exposed $c$ is the parameter that can be changed through social distancing.

    $\gamma$ is the inverse of the mean recovery time, in days.  I.e.: if $\gamma = 1/{recovery_days}$, then the average infection will clear in {recovery_days} days.

    An important descriptive parameter is the _basic reproduction number_, or $R_0$.  This represents the average number of people who will be infected by any given infected person.  When $R_0$ is greater than 1, it means that a disease will grow.  Higher $R_0$'s imply more rapid growth.  It is defined as
  "$R_0$ gets bigger when...": |+

    $R_0$ gets bigger when

    - there are more contacts between people
    - when the pathogen is more virulent
    - when people have the pathogen for longer periods of time

    A doubling time of {doubling_time} days and a recovery time of {recovery_days} days imply an $R_0$ of {r_naught:.2f}.

    #### Effect of social distancing

    After the beginning of the outbreak, actions to reduce social contact will lower the parameter $c$.  If this happens at
    time $t$, then the number of people infected by any given infected person is $R_t$, which will be lower than $R_0$.

    A {relative_contact_rate:.0%} reduction in social contact would increase the time it takes for the outbreak to double,
    to {doubling_time_t:.2f} days from {doubling_time:.2f} days, with a $R_t$ of {r_t:.2f}.

    #### Using the model

    We need to express the two parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in terms of quantities we can estimate.

    - $\gamma$:  the CDC is recommending 14 days of self-quarantine, we'll use $\gamma = 1/{recovery_days}$.
    - To estimate $$\beta$$ directly, we'd need to know transmissibility and social contact rates.  since we don't know these things, we can extract it from known _doubling times_.  The AHA says to expect a doubling time $T_d$ of 7-10 days. That means an early-phase rate of growth can be computed by using the doubling time formula:
  "Since the rate of new infections in the SIR model...": |+
    - Since the rate of new infections in the SIR model is $g = \beta S - \gamma$, and we've already computed $\gamma$, $\beta$ becomes a function of the initial population size of susceptible individuals.
    $$\beta = (g + \gamma)$$.
